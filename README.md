# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repo was created by Clint Woody for submission as the final course project 
to the Getting and Cleaning data class.

## Dataset

The data was given to us by Coursera at this [link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

## Files

* codebook.Rmd includes the description of variables, data sets used, and transformation
of data sets into the final tidy data.

* run_analysis.R is the script that executes the 5 requirements outlined in the 
project assignment.
  + 1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  + 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  + 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  + 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  + 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
        
* Tidydata.txt is a file of the final tidy data asked for in question 5.
